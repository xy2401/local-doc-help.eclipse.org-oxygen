<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/viatra/">VIATRA</a> is an open source model transformation framework, focusing on efficient evaluation of model queries and supports various transformation workflows. This document contains a tutorial for getting started with the query and transformation development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tutorial relies on the <a href="https://github.com/viatra/viatra-docs/blob/master/cps/Home.adoc">CPS Demonstrator application</a>. The CPS Demonstrator is specified to cover a usual workflow in Model-driven Engineering, where a system is (1) first described in a source model, then (2) automated model-to-model transformations are used to derive a target model. Finally, (3) model-to-text transformation is performed to generate code from the target domain. In addition, a model generator that can automatically create source domain models can support the correctness testing and performance evaluation of the components. This tutorial uses only a subset of the transformation problem, as its main goal is to illustrate the basics of the VIATRA environment. Consult the original demonstrator for a more complex transformation example.</p>

<p>We expect readers to be familiar with the basics of Eclipse plug-in development, more specifically creating plug-in projects and defining basic UI extensions such as commands. Additionally, we expect a basic understanding of EMF-based modeling. If required, look at the Plug-in development tutorial at <a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugin/article.html" class="bare">http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePlugin/article.html</a> or the EMF tutorial at <a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseEMF/article.html" class="bare">http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseEMF/article.html</a> for a short presentation on these subjects.</p>

<p>This tutorial includes a <strong>quick setup guide</strong>, then describes both <strong>model query development</strong> and their usage in the <strong>query runtime</strong>. Then, both <strong>batch</strong> and <strong>event-driven transformations</strong> are covered.</p>

<p>This document is intended only as a short tutorial for the usage of the Query and Transformation capabilities of VIATRA. A more detailed documentation is maintained at <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/VIATRA" class="bare">http://wiki.eclipse.org/VIATRA</a>.</p>

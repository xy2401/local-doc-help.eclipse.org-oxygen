<tr><th>Code</th><th>Message</th><th>Happens when</th><th>Solution</th></tr>
<tr><td>E155011</td><td>Commit failed (details follow):<br/>Directory '...' is out of date</td><td>Trying to commit file or folder rename</td><td>Update the working copy which contains the changes recursively starting with its root.</td></tr>
<tr><td>E155021</td><td>Unsupported working copy format</td><td>Any SVN action over a working copy (synchronize, commit and so on), using an incompatible connector (for example SVN 1.7 connector with SVN 1.6 working copy)</td><td>In order to solve the issue you can:<ul><li>select a compatible connector at <b>Window->Preferences->Team->SVN->SVN Connector</b> if available. If there is no required connector, you can check the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/subversive/downloads.php">Subversive Connectors update site</a> section;</li><li>upgrade a working copy using context menu action <b>Team->Upgrade Projects...</b> (in case you wish to migrate your project 1.6->1.7 or 1.7->1.8). Please note, that SVN Kit 1.8 connector will work as is with the working copy in SVN 1.7 format and will upgrade it silently.</li></ul></td></tr>

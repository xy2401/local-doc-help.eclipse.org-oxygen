<h3>Subversive unique features</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Realizes the full support of Repository location layouts, recommended by Subversion&reg;.</li>
	<li>Provides the way to browse through not just project structure but revisions too directly in the repository location view.</li>
	<li>Allows to freeze svn:externals while creating tags and branches.</li>
	<li>There is a way to search automatically for Eclipse projects in the repository's specified location.</li>
	<li>Supports group operations which simplifies management of the multiple projects in the same workspace.</li>
	<li>It is extensible and has well defined API.</li>
	<li>Each Subversive plug-in release warrants support for the last three Eclipse Platform releases (and all related update releases), so that you won't be forced to change your working environment when you need a new Subversive version installed.</li>
</ul>
